        <h3>Memory management refers to management of Primary Memory or Main Memory.
        Main memory is a large array of words or bytes where each word or byte has its own address.</h3>
        <br><br>
        <h4>Main memory provides a fast storage that can be accessed directly by the CPU. For a program to be executed, it must in the main memory.
             An Operating System does the following activities for memory management: </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Keeps tracks of primary memory, i.e., what part of it are in use by whom, what part are not in use.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In multiprogramming, the OS decides which process will get memory when and how much.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Allocates the memory when a process requests it to do so.</li>
            <br>
            <li>De-allocates the memory when a process no longer needs it or has been terminated.</li>
        </ul>
